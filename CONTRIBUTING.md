# Contributing

To get started developing you will need to first clone the repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:nicholaswall/CS5-7319-Final-Project-Group-03-Nick-Wall_Diogo-Rodrigues.git
```

Then you will need to ensure that poetry is installed as it manages virtual environments and dependencies.
You can find instructions on how to install poetry [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

Now with poetry installed you can install the dependencies for the project by running

```bash
poetry install
```

Finally you can run either of the architectures by running the appropriate command

```bash
./mvc/run.sh
./pipe_filter/run.sh
```
